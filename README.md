## Voting

Votes are made by using reactions on the top level comment of the Pull Request.

| Yes | No | Abstain |
|-----|----|---------|
| ![+1](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png "+1") | ![-1](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44e.png "+1") | ![confused](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f615.png "confused") |

An `Abstain` vote counts when calculating quorum but is discarded when checking to see if the vote passed.

Voting for more than one option can be disabled on a per project basis.
